doFolder - A One Stop File System Management Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

doFolder is a powerful, intuitive, and cross-platform file system management library
that provides a high-level, object-oriented interface for working with files and
directories. It simplifies common file operations such as creating, moving, copying,
deleting, and comparing files and directories while offering advanced features like
hashing, content manipulation, and directory tree operations.

Key Features:
    * **Object-oriented Design**: Work with files and directories as Python objects
    * **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Seamlessly works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
    * **Advanced Path Handling**: Built on Python's pathlib for robust path management
    * **File Operations**: Create, move, copy, delete, and modify files and directories
    * **Content Management**: Read and write file content with encoding support
    * **Directory Tree Operations**: Navigate and manipulate directory structures
    * **File Comparison**: Compare files and directories with various comparison modes
    * **Hash Support**: Generate and verify file hashes for integrity checking
    * **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error modes for different use cases
    * **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support and code reliability

Quick Start:
    >>> import doFolder
    >>>
    >>> # Create directory and file objects
    >>> project_dir = doFolder.Directory("./my_project")
    >>> config_file = doFolder.File("./my_project/config.json")
    >>>
    >>> # Create a new file in the directory
    >>> new_file = project_dir.create("readme.txt", doFolder.ItemType.FILE)
    >>>
    >>> # Write content to the file
    >>> new_file.content = "Hello, World!".encode("utf-8")
    >>>
    >>> # Create a subdirectory
    >>> sub_dir = project_dir.create("data", doFolder.ItemType.DIR)
    >>>
    >>> # Copy and move files
    >>> backup_file = new_file.copy("./backup/")
    >>> new_file.move("./archive/")

Main Classes:
    * **File**: Represents a file in the file system with methods for content
      manipulation, copying, moving, and deletion.
    * **Directory**: Represents a directory with methods for creating, listing,
      and managing contained files and subdirectories.
    * **Path**: Enhanced path handling with additional utility methods.

Enums and Types:
    * **ItemType**: Enumeration for file system item types (FILE, DIR).
    * **UnExistsMode**: Defines behavior when a path doesn't exist (WARN, ERROR,
      IGNORE, CREATE).

Utility Functions:
    * **createItem()**: Factory function to create File or Directory objects
      based on path type.
    * **isDir()**: Type guard to check if an item is a directory.

Advanced Features:
    * **File Comparison**: The `compare` module provides comprehensive comparison
      capabilities for files and directories.
    * **Hash Operations**: Built-in support for file hashing and verification.
    * **Flexible Error Handling**: Configurable error modes for different
      scenarios.
    * **Path Utilities**: Advanced path manipulation and formatting functions.
